## 🎯 What the Error Was About

**Issue:** Browsers block local file access for security reasons when you open HTML files directly (file:// protocol).

**Solution:** Running a local server (http:// protocol) bypasses this restriction.

**Files Created to Help:**

1. ✅ Enhanced `dashboard.js` - Now tries multiple paths and shows helpful error messages
2. ✅ `START_SERVER.bat` - Easy double-click server starter
3. ✅ `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.html` - Visual setup guide
4. ✅ This file - Quick reference

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep the terminal open** while using the dashboard
2. **Bookmark** http://localhost:8000 for quick access
3. **Use filters** to explore specific data subsets
4. **Hover over charts** for detailed information
5. **Press Ctrl+P** to print or save as PDF
